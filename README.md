Solicitor is a tool which helps managing Open Source Software used within projects. Information about Open Source Software used/bundled within applications might be imported from various technical sources (like the output generated from the maven license plugin). Customizable rules are used for normalizing the license information, selecting the appropriate licenses in dual-/multilicensing cases and evaluating if the setup complies with the restrictions defined for the project. Text or spreadsheet (Excel) based reports might be created to document the results of the evaluation.
